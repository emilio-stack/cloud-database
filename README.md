# Overview
This is a simple program to interact with a Cloud Database. It is a simple menu that calls class mehtods to perform C.R.U.D. interactions with the database. 

My purpose in writing this software is purely to gain experience working with cloud databases. It is to gain experience reading documentation and setting up code environments.

# Cloud Database

I am using Google Firebase service for a noSQL database.

All data is stored under collections and documents. A database can have many collections and a collection can have many documents. 

# Development Environment

VS CODE

Google Firebase

# Useful Websites

* [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/build)
* [Google Cloud Docs](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/firestore/latest)

# Future Work

* Error handeling in the menu
* Adding custom collection names
* Iterating through collections
